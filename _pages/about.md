Hi! I'm Wanting Li!
======

I'm a **third-year** undergraduate in Computer Science at the [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/). Recently, I've been conducting research on an **experimental study on vector database in RAG** in [SUSTech DBGroup](https://dbgroup.sustech.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof.Bo Tang](https://acm.sustech.edu.cn/btang/).

I plan to apply for a **PhD** program in **Fall 2026**. I'm currently seeking for a **research internship** in **Spring 2025 or Summer 2025**. 

I am highly enthusiastic about exploring various research domains within the fields of data science and deep learning/machine learning to identify my future research interests. 

Publications
======
- Working on improving the memory efficiency and accuracy of sparse attention in LLM inference

    We are proposing a new sparse attention algorithm that reduces memory cost by leveraging the tiered memory architecture and preserves accuracy by effective KV cache compression.
  
- Working on an experimental study on vector databases in RAG

    I am conducting experiments on Googleâ€™s Natural Questions dataset to explore how recall adjustments and answer shortening impact RAG's performance.
